# Repository Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments completed as part of my Master's degree in Data Science. The files within this repository are primarily for demonstration purposes to showcase the work I have conducted during my studies.

## Please Note:
- The notebooks and scripts here are provided as examples of my academic work and are not intended for direct replication.
- The original data files such as `.csv` and `.txt` used for these analyses are not included because the repository is not set up for re-execution, but rather to demonstrate the methodologies and results of my projects.

## Purpose of This Repository:
- The main goal of sharing these files is to demonstrate my technical skills and the analytical approaches I have taken to solve various data science problems.
- This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, illustrating both my capabilities and learning progress throughout my master's program.

Thank you for visiting my repository. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the projects further, please feel free to contact me.
